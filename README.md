# Test Analytics Platform

Playwright tests run in CI, emit structured results to a warehouse, get modelled with dbt,
and surface as a test-health dashboard in Power BI and Tableau.

**Stack:** Playwright + TypeScript · GitHub Actions · Docker · Python ETL · dbt-duckdb · DuckDB · Power BI / Tableau

## Why

Test suites produce a large amount of data that most teams throw away — test name, status,
duration, browser, retry count, error message, timestamp, emitted on every run and deleted
once the build goes green.

"The build is green" is a point-in-time answer to what are really trend questions:
**what's flaky, what's slowing us down, are we ready to release?**

This project treats test results as a data product.

## Architecture

```
Playwright  →  results.json  →  DuckDB  →  dbt  →  Power BI / Tableau
                    ↑
            GitHub Actions (push + nightly)
```

## Status

Phase 1 — Playwright suite, in progress. Phases 2–7 (CI/CD, Docker, Python ETL, dbt, BI
layer, cloud) follow.

## Layout

```
tests/
  ui/         UI specs (saucedemo.com)
  api/        API specs
  pages/      Page objects
  fixtures/   Shared test fixtures
pipeline/     Python: parse Playwright JSON reports -> DuckDB
warehouse/    dbt project (models, schema tests) + DuckDB file
dashboards/   Power BI / Tableau assets + screenshots
```

Directories beyond `tests/` are created in their respective phases.

## Running the tests

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright test
```

Results land in `results/results.json` — this is the pipeline's source data.
An HTML report is also written to `playwright-report/`.
